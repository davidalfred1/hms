 $user = mysqli_fetch_assoc($result);
 mysqli_fetch_assoc can be used to fetch for data in the db


<?php
$number = 10;

if ($number > 5):
    echo "The number is greater than 5.";
else:
    echo "The number is 5 or less.";
endif;
?>


NOTE:
- add exit(); after each header() to prevent further execution

- to pull sql db and move to the your remote xampp: mysql -u root your_db_name < database_backup.sql


if(isset($_GET['delete'])){
    $delete = $_GET['delete'];
    $sql = "DELETE FROM users WHERE id=$id";
    $query = mysqli_query($conn, $sql);
    if($query){
        header('location: viewuser.php?id=User Successfully Deleted!');
        exit();
    }
}
